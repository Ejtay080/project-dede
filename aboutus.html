                <p class="aboutustxt"><strong>CFLOOR TECH</strong> is a manufacturer of sea-exploration goods. We sell many products such as submarines, underwater cameras, undersea maps, diving equipment, etc. We also team with multiple local and global corporations such as the <u>Marine Science Camp</u>, and the <u>Ocean Institute</u>. Our main goal is to explore our planet as much as possible, and as often as possible. We love to hire other people who are interested in marine biology, and the preservation of our oceans. Since the Ocean is the majority of our Earth, and we have only explored 5% of it, to us it becomes clear that we must explore it.
